## About the creator
My name is Viktoria and I'm a student at Blekinge institute of Technology in Blekinge, Sweden. Here I study to become a Web programmer
and I graduate in June 2019. My goal is to become a front end developer and web designer when I graduate, due to my interest in
designing websites.

My roots are in Strömsholm, Västmanland but my home is in Karlskrona, Blekinge. Besides from web programming I enjoy training,
a nice beer with friends and photography.
